# USA-wildfires-project
This project has been a common thread throughout my data analyst training. It was carried out in a group with my colleagues and the aim was to start with a database of over 2 million forest fires in the United States and try to predict the occurrence of forest fires in a given county as a function of certain variables. 

This very detailed project enabled us to work on all the stages of a data analyst's project: 
- cleaning and preparing a database
- aggregation of the database using data available online (weather data, geographical data, etc.) 
- exploration and visualisation of the dataset
- creation of a machine learning model to establish our predictions
